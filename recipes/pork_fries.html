      <li>
          Remove tenderloin from packaging and place on cutting board; cut into 3 equal length sections, each about 3 inches long. 
          Slice each section into 1/4- to 1/2-inch diameter strips.
          You will end up with approximately 34 strips that are similar in size and shape to French fries.
      </li>
      <li>
          Place eggs, breadcrumbs and flour into separate bowls.
          Dredge pork strips in flour, coat with beaten egg, and toss in breadcrumbs.
      </li>
      <li>
          Pour oil into large skillet until 1/4 inch deep; heat over medium-high until breadcrumb dropped in oil sizzles. 
          Gently place approximately 8 breaded pork strips into oil, making sure not to overcrowd them. 
          Fry approximately 1 1/2 minutes per side until golden brown, crisp, and internal temperature of pork is at least 150 degrees F.; drain on paper towels. 
          Repeat until all pork strips are fried. Note that stove temperature may need to be reduced to prevent burning when the oil level lowers after a few batches.
      </li>
      <li>
    Serve with BBQ sauce, sriracha mayonnaise, or ranch dressing for dipping.
